        <p>I am a 20 years old, ambitious young student determined to complete my computer science degree and build a strong foundation for the future. My goal is not only to graduate but also to use my knowledge to create meaningful solutions that can make an impact in society. As a family centered man, I am driven, focused, and eager to grow, seeing every challenge as a stepping stone toward achieving  dream of becoming a successful and skilled computer scientist. I am interested in web development because I believe the skills associated are essential for a computer scientiest, i.e achieving my goal.</p>
